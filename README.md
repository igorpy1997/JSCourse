## Lab Assignments

### 1. Variables and Data Types

First topic covering JavaScript variables and data types fundamentals.

#### typesList
- Create a repository with an index.html file
- Add a small script that displays all known data types in the console using the `typeof` operator and `console.log`

### 2. Operators and Control Flow

Second topic covering JavaScript operators, conditional statements, and basic flow control.

#### promptWork

#### numberCheck
- Given a three-digit number provided by the user, determine:
