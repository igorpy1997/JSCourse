## Course Description

This repository contains practical assignments for the JavaScript course. The course includes an in-depth study of JavaScript from the basics to its frameworks. The repository is organized by topics, with each topic containing multiple lab assignments.

## How to Clone the Repository

### Clone the Entire Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igorpy1997/JSCourse.git
cd JSCourse
```

### Clone a Specific Folder (using sparse checkout)

```bash
# Clone repository with minimal depth
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/igorpy1997/JSCourse.git
cd JSCourse

# Set up sparse-checkout for a specific folder
git sparse-checkout set variablesAndType/typesList

# Update from remote repository
git pull origin main
```

## Lab Assignments

### 1. Variables and Data Types

First topic covering JavaScript variables and data types fundamentals.

#### typesList
- Create a repository with an index.html file
- Add a small script that displays all known data types in the console using the `typeof` operator and `console.log`

#### numbersAndStrings
- Get three lines from the user and display them in any order with a single command (template strings)

#### fiveDigitParser
- Break down a five-digit number by digits and display it in the output with spaces between digits
- Example: 10369 â†’ 1 0 3 6 9

### 2. Operators and Control Flow

Second topic covering JavaScript operators, conditional statements, and basic flow control.

#### promptWork
- Use prompt to ask for the "user's name"
- Use alert to display "Hello, John! How are you?", where "John" is the name entered by the user

#### numberCheck
- Given a three-digit number provided by the user, determine:
    - Are all digits the same?
    - Are there any identical digits?

#### userProfile
- Create a script that:
    - Asks the user for their birth year
    - Asks them which city they live in
    - Asks for their favorite sport
    - When clicking OK, display a window showing:
        - Their age
        - If the user enters Kyiv, Washington, or London, show the message "You live in the capital of..." with the appropriate country
        - Otherwise, show "You live in [city]" where [city] is the entered city

#### switchCaseUsage
- Rewrite given code using the switch...case construct

### 3. Loops and Iterations

Third topic covering JavaScript loops, iterations, and number processing.

#### numberOutput
- Display numbers from 20 to 30 with a step of 0.5 (20, 20.5, 21, 21.5, ...)

#### currencyCalculation
- One dollar costs 26 hryvnias. Display data with the calculated value of 10, 20, 30... 100 dollars

#### findNumbers
- Given a whole number N (entered via prompt), display all whole numbers from 1 to 100 whose square does not exceed N

#### isPrimeNumber
- Given a whole number (entered via prompt), determine if it is prime (a prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself)

As the course progresses, more topics and labs will be added to this repository.
